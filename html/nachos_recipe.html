      <li>8 oz picante or salsa</li>
      <li>4 oz sour cream</li>
      <li>3 lbs of ground beef</li>
      <li>3/4 cups taco seasoning</li>
      <li>2 1/4 cups water</li>
      <li>1/2 cup of pickled jalapenos-sliced</li>
      <li>1/2 of a white onion-diced</li>
      <li>8oz of your choice of shredded cheese</li>
      <li>4 oz guacomole</li>
  </ul>
  <!--
  <h2>Equipment</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>large skillet w/ lid</li>
      <li>platter</li>
      <li>spatula</li>
      <li>knife</li>
     <li>optional: hand torch to melt cheese</li> -->
  </ul>
  <h2>instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li> Brown ground beef in large skillet on medium high heat. Afterwards stir in the taco seasoning and water. Bring that up to a boil then reduce the heat and simmer it for 20 minutes covered with the lid</li>
    <li>Once the meat is done cooking dump the chips onto the platter and begin layering the nachos how you'd like. Recomend starting with the cheese, meat, and (heated up) queso first as your base. afterwards layering on the pico/salsa and applying dollaps of the sour cream and guacamole ontop to add some variety when eating it. finally sprinkleing on the jalapenos and onion on top to give the nachos a nice visual aspect.</li>
    <li>OPTIONAL: If you have a hand torch you can swap the order you add the meat cheese and queso so that the cheese is ontop and you can use your torch to melt said cheese. This can also be achieved by melting the cheese in the oven but then you risk letting the meat and queso turning your crisp chips into a soggy mess.</li>
    <li>Once you've assembled your nachos how you like just take them to where ever they're going to be devoured and enjoy the fun.</li>
